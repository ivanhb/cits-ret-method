Starting from a retracted article, we present a step by step methodology for collecting and annotating the citing entities' in-text citations. Two main services are used during this analysis: (a) The APIs of COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI references [http://opencitations.net/index/coci](http://opencitations.net/index/coci), and (b) the RetractionWatch database, a collection of retracted articles over the academic world [http://retractiondatabase.org/](http://retractiondatabase.org/).This methodology is divided into 5 steps: (1) identifying and retrieving the resources, (2) annotating the citing entities characteristics, (3) classifying the citing entities into subjects of study, (4) extracting textual values from the citing entities, and (5) annotating the in-text citations' characteristics. At the end of our proposed analysis, we have a collection of annotated in-text citations enclosed in one dataset. Starting from an empty dataset, each step of the methodology (from 1 to 5) enriches it with new variables.
