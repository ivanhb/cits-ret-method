Giving a retracted article, we present a step-by-step methodology for gathering the raw-data of the documents which have cited such article (starting from the date of its publication) and annotating the metadata and features for such citing entities. The external services used for our purpose are all free and open. The methodology uses three external services: (a) OpenCitations COCI ([http://opencitations.net/index/coci](http://opencitations.net/index/coci), used to retrieve citation data), (b) RetractionWatch database ([http://retractiondatabase.org/](http://retractiondatabase.org/), used to retrieve information of retracted articles), and (c) SCImago ([https://www.scimagojr.com/](https://www.scimagojr.com/), to retrieve subject areas and subject categories of publications). The methodology is divided into five steps: (1) identifying and retrieving the citing entities, (2) retrieving the citing entities characteristics, (3) classifying the citing entities according to subject areas and subject categories, (4) extracting textual values from the citing entities, and (5) annotating the in-text citations characteristics. 
The application of this methodology produces a dataset containing all the citing entities and their annotated data/features. Starting from an empty dataset, each step of the methodology (from 1 to 5) enriches it with new variables.
