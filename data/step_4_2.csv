The suggestion that measles infection is causally linked to Crohn's disease had been disproved already6 but there has since been a decrease in MMR vaccination uptake with the potential for future morbidity. 7 The basis for the early report was 12 children whose parents had reported the onset of bowel disease and autism soon after MMR vaccination. 5The age when these conditions first appear however, is also the age for MMR vaccination. ;;
The publication of the 'early report' based on only 12 patients resulted in a prodigious correspondence which canvassed the rift which can exist between clinical medicine and public health, 12 and the inadequacy of evidence related to problems of methodology. 11-21 The controversy in that correspondence was whether or not the paper byWakefield5 should have been accepted for publication. It attracted mass media attention and generated considerable public concern despite the lack of evidence linking MMR vaccination with the conditions suffered by the 12 children.",5

Anecdotal reports of the coincidence of certain physiological anomalies in subgroups of children with autistic spectrum disorders, outside the syndrome's diagnostic definition, have not as yet been adequately catalogued.

final section; “Discussion”","The factors that were revealed, however, indicate the need for further investigation into the possible links between the autistic syndrome and the prevalence of physiological factors.
Speculation about a possible interplay between autism and various biochemical systems of the body, such as the immune system (Warren et al., 1996; Van Gent et al., 1997; Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998), suggests that speciﬁc behaviours associated with the autistic syndrome could also be accompanied by speciﬁc physiological problems associated with affected systems of the body. The ﬁndings that nearly two-thirds of Children showed a history of eczema or similar skin complaints, and over a quarter had problems with asthma—related conditions (both exceeding the general population incidence ﬁgures), imply the involvement of the immune system in some fashion.;;
The incidence of migraines is compatible With the phenyls ulphotransferase enzyme deﬁciency hypothesis (Waring et al.,1996), which has also been associated with subsequent physiological difﬁculties such as problems with intestinal permeability (Waring and
Ngong, 1993; Shattock and Savery, 1996). The signiﬁcance of a link between parental and sibling health problems (especially related to problems of the immune system) and the presence of physiological symptoms coexisting with the overt diagnostic deﬁnition of autism
supports the View of autism being an organic disorder, either immunological or metabolic (Shattock and Savery, 1996 ; Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998), with a genetic basis at least, in a subgroup of children.","Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998"

Biochemical evidence has indicated the presence of increased levels of peptides in the urine of people with autism, and previous behavioural studies have demonstrated a connection between the long term exclusion of gluten and casein from the diet and improvements in the behaviour of some children with autism. The introduction of a gluten-free diet to children with autism and associated spectrum disorders (n 5 22) was monitored over a 5 month period using a battery of parental and teacher interview/questionnaire sessions, observation reports, psychometric tests and urinary profiling. Results suggested that participants on a gluten-free diet showed an improvement on a number of behavioural measures. However there was no significant decrease in specific urinary compounds excreted when compared with controls and a gluten challenge group.","introduction;;

final section;“Discussion”","The ‘opioid-excess’ theory of autism (Panksepp, 1979; Reichelt et al., 1981; 1993; 1994; Shattock et al., 1990; Wakefield et al., 1998) suggests that autism is the consequence of the action of peptides1 of exogenous origin affecting neurotransmission within the central nervous system (CNS). Peptides,2 formed through the incomplete breakdown of foods2 containing gluten (found in cereal produce) and casein (derived from dairy produce), exhibit direct opioid activity or form ligands for the peptidase enzymes which break down endogenous endorphins and enkephalins. ;;
Peptides,2 formed through the incomplete breakdown of foods2 containing gluten (found in cereal produce) and casein (derived from dairy produce), exhibit direct opioid activity or form ligands for the peptidase enzymes which break down endogenous endorphins and enkephalins. The passage of elevated levels of peptides through to the CNS is further aided by gastrointestinal conditions indicative of an abnormally porous intestinal membrane (Waring and Ngong, 1993; Gardner, 1994; D’Eufemia et al., 1996; Wakefield et al., 1998). The resultant presence of intensified opioid activity disrupts a variety of systems within the CNS. ;;
Problems with intestinal permeability have been found in a proportion of children with autism (D’Eufemia et al., 1996). Similarly, the gastrointestinal findings following measles-mumps-rubella immunization (MMR) reported by Wakefield et al. (1998) suggest impaired intestinal function and increased permeability. The increased levels of IAG3 and other, as yet unidentified, compounds found in the urine of people with tenuous autism also provides support for the existence of an abnormally porous intestinal membrane.","Wakeﬁeld et al., 1998"

Psychiatry and Mental Health;;","Background
The rapid increase in research endeavour has not kept pace with the advent of well-publicised theories and treatments for autism.
Aims
To explore some of the newer developments in biological research into autism.
Method
A review of recent publications and presentations.
Results
The concept is shifting from the narrow perception of aloof autism, described by Kanner, to a wider one that includes a spectrum extending to a broader, subclinical phenotype. The genetic basis has been established; now we need to discover the location and interaction of the relevant sites. There is considerable interest in the bowel as a pathogenetic agent, particularly in the effects of exogenous opioids and multiple viral infection (the latter posing a public health problem). Also of concern is the role of (potentially treatable) epilepsy, analogous to the Laudau-Kleffner syndrome.
Conclusions
In the absence of a cure, the implementation of ideas will continue to outstrip factual evidence. Clinicians are challenged by the availability of information (and misinformation), particularly on the internet.
",middle section;“AETIOLOGY”,"More tangible has been the discovery of lymphoid hyperplasia near the ileo-caecal junction in children who had been selected on the basis of an autistic regression together with current bowel symptoms (Wakefield et al, 1998c ). The regression occurred immediately after immunisation in only one-third of the subjects, but nearly all the biopsy specimens showed evidence of measles infection (Wakefield et al, 1998a ). This suggests that measles might act in conjunction with another factor, whether genetic predisposition, intercurrent infection or multiple immunisation, to trigger a chronic inflammatory response.","Wakefield et al, 1998a"

Several common sources of uncertainties in scientific literature are characterized, notably, retracted scientific publications, hedging, and conflicting findings. Semantically equivalent uncertainty cue words and their connections with semantic predications are identified and visualized as the first step towards a sys- tematic study of uncertainties in accessing and communicating the status of sci- entific assertions. ",“Retraction”;middle Section;;,"In such situations, the uncertainty should increase and scientific knowledge as a collective belief system should be rolled back to the point prior to the publication of the retracted article. Notorious examples of retracted studies include the highly controversial study on the connection between MMR vaccines and autism by Wakefield et al.

More recently, the retracted 1998 publication of a hypothesized link between the measles-mumps- rubella vaccine and autism (Wakefield et al. 1998) (RETRACTED) generated much concern over vaccine safety and undermined public confidence in vaccines, despite the subsequent convincing evidence rejecting any causal association (DeStefano and Thompson 2004). Not surprisingly, the HPV vaccine has been among the most scrutinized and controversial vaccines since its first licensure in 2006. ",Wakefield et al. 1998
